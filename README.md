# Random Number Generator
This is a Python script that generates a random set of numbers and then repeatedly generates new sets until it finds a match with the initially generated set.

## How it Works
The script uses the random module to generate a set of 6 unique numbers between 1 and 40. It then converts these numbers into a string and sets it as the "Target Number". After that, it enters a loop where it generates new sets of numbers until it finds a match with the target number. Once a match is found, it prints out the matching set and the time taken to find it.

# Usage
To run the script, simply execute the Python file randomNumberMatch.py
